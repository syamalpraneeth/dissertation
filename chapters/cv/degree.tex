%& Synthesized a novel quantum magnet $PbCuTeO_{5}$ which has a 2D distorted checkboard lattice, and is characterised by a weak ferromagnetic transition at $\sim 6K$, and also has a Curie-Weiss temperature of $\sim 165 K$ ($\therefore$ $f \sim 28 $). Determined that it is a moderately frustrated system with evidence of the frustrated correlations in the paramagnetic region.\\
